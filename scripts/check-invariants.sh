# Repository invariants (gate G31, FR125): pins, toolchain agreement, gate set, repository name, licence,
# blanket suppressions and the execution switch. One rule per letter:
#   (a) workflow hygiene: pinned actions, permissions (declared, none that writes at the top level; a job writes only
#       security-events in the code-scanning jobs codeql, clippy-sarif-upload and code-scanning, or any scope in the
#       release and sync jobs of a workflow that no pull request starts; write-all nowhere), concurrency, timeouts
#       (declared, an integer of at most 45 minutes, 75 for the clean-clone job clean-bootstrap-ci of scheduled.yml);
#       a quoted key ('jobs':, "pull-requests":) is read as the key it names, a permissions value is read-all,
#       write-all or a mapping whose every value is read, write or none (a tag, anchor or alias is reported), and a
#       job is a block mapping under a plain key at two spaces with its keys at four (a flow mapping, an anchor, an
#       alias, a merge key, a tag or another indentation is reported)
#   (b) pinned images, tools, features and downloads (Dockerfile, make files, workflows and every shell script): no
#       file has more downloads by URL than checksum verifications (sha256sum, sha512sum or shasum run as a command,
#       or a call of a shell function whose body runs one; comments and image digests are no evidence), and an ADD
#       of a URL in the Dockerfile carries --checksum=
#   (c) one toolchain version in rust-toolchain.toml, the builder image tag and rust-version
#   (d) the gate set of `make ci-list` equals the gate set of the pull-request workflows (and every workflow runs
#       only gate and CI-only targets); Bats groups; required checks
#   (e) the repository name occurs only where DD-23 allows it
#   (f) the licence identifier is CC0-1.0 everywhere it is stated
#   (g) no `allow` attribute, no `expect` in a crate root (by name, by place or named by a manifest), no lint group in
#       an `allow` or `expect` (also inside a `cfg_attr`); an inline suppression directive of shellcheck, hadolint,
#       yamllint, markdownlint, ESLint or zizmor names exactly one rule (not all rules, not a group, not a list) and
#       carries a reason: `# <reason>` after a shellcheck, hadolint or zizmor directive, ` -- <reason>` after an
#       ESLint one, or for every directive a comment line directly above it
#   (h) toolchain commands run behind $(EXEC)
#
# Usage: check-invariants.sh [--root <dir>]
# Prints one line per violation, prefixed with the rule letter, and nothing otherwise.
# Exit status: 0 no violation; 1 at least one violation; 2 the script could not run.

# (g) Inline directives of the repository linters
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A linter of G23 or the load-test kit accepts an inline directive that names no rule or several and carries no
# reason; rule (g) refuses it (FR125(g), the definition of a blanket suppression). The directives that suppress are
# read where the linter itself reads them (the directive words are quoted, so that no line here is a directive):
#   - `# shellcheck disable=...`: a comment (outside quotes, expansions and here-document bodies) of the shell files
#     and of the run blocks of the workflows; `source=`, `shell=` and `enable=` suppress nothing
#   - `# hadolint ignore=...` and `# hadolint global ignore=...`: a comment line of a Dockerfile*
#   - `# yamllint disable`, `disable-line` and `disable-file` (on the first line): a YAML comment outside quoted and
#     block scalars of a *.yml or *.yaml file
#   - `<!-- markdownlint-disable -->`, `-disable-line`, `-disable-next-line`, `-disable-file` and
#     `markdownlint-configure-file`: anywhere in a line of a *.md file, as markdownlint matches them
#   - `eslint-disable` and a configuration of rules (`eslint <rule>: <setting>`) in a block comment,
#     `eslint-disable-line` and `-next-line` in any comment: a *.js, *.mjs or *.cjs file below tests/Load/, outside
#     strings, template literals and regular expression literals
#   - `# zizmor: ignore[...]`: a YAML comment of a workflow
# The files are those git lists below the root, tracked or new and not ignored (every file when the root has no
# .git); specs/, _bmad*/, tests/CLI/bats/fixtures/ and every node_modules/ and target/ directory are not read.
