# Make targets

`make help` lists every target with its help text. This reference adds, for each target, its class, what it needs and whether `make ci` runs it, and then covers the PHP-to-Rust target mapping, the CI-only steps, where each gate's passing run and negative test are, the targets without a Bats test, and the inputs that only a script reads.

The ordered list of gate targets is not repeated here. It lives in one place, the verification section of [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md#verification), and `make ci-list` prints it.

## Classes and execution

- **TOOL** targets run cargo, `sqlx`, `xtask`, the `service` binary, `taplo`, `typos` or `zizmor`. They run natively in the current environment by default. With `RUN_IN_CONTAINER=1` (or `true`) they run as `docker compose exec` in the development container, so no toolchain is needed on the host; the environment must be up (`make start`). The opt-in is ignored, and the command runs natively, when `CI` is non-empty or when `IN_DEV_CONTAINER=1` (set in the `app` container, so also in a `make sh` shell).
- **HOST** targets drive Docker themselves (lifecycle, image-based tools, load tests, Bats) or are plain host commands. They always run where Make runs and print nothing special in container mode. A HOST target that calls the container engine exits with status 2 and `This target needs a reachable container engine (docker).` when `docker info` fails.
- **Needs** names the compose services that must be healthy: `database` is PostgreSQL, `localstack` is the SQS emulator, `app` is the development container. Targets that need services start them through their prerequisites (`ensure-deps`, `ensure-database`, `setup-test-db`) with `docker compose up --no-recreate`, so a service that already runs is never stopped or altered. "The isolated environment" means the target starts and removes the production-image environment of the load tests itself.
- **The test database.** The targets that use it (`setup-test-db`, `validate-sqlx-metadata`, `integration-tests`, `e2e-tests`, the coverage and mutation targets, `sqlx-prepare`) run behind `scripts/with-env.sh .env .env.test --` with `DATABASE_URL` removed first, so they always use the database `<DB_NAME>_test` of `.env.test`, even when the shell exports a `DATABASE_URL` for the development database (a habit of `sqlx-cli` users). Every other variable of the caller still wins over the two files; set `DB_PORT` or `DB_NAME` to move the test database. `scripts/setup-test-db.sh` itself refuses, with status 2, a database whose name does not end in `_test`, because it drops the database it is given.
- **In `make ci`** says whether the aggregate runs the target; the gate in brackets is the gate it passes (G1 to G31).

## PHP target to Rust target

All 68 targets of the PHP template are accounted for. "Kept" means the same name and the same capability.

| PHP target | Rust target | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `help`, `start`, `up`, `build`, `stop`, `down`, `sh`, `logs`, `new-logs`, `purge`, `clean` | kept | `start` now rebuilds stale images incrementally; `purge` removes real generated paths |
| `install`, `update` | kept | pinned tools plus `cargo fetch --locked`; `cargo update` |
| `composer-validate` | renamed `validate-manifest` | lock file check; the each-crate build is the new `check-crate-isolation` |
| `check-requirements`, `check-security` | kept | `service check-config`; `cargo deny --locked check` |
| `commands` | dropped | `make help` and `service --help` list everything |
| `cache-clear`, `cache-warmup` | dropped | no framework cache exists |
| `doctrine-migrations-migrate` | renamed `migrate` | plus `migrate-rollback` |
| `doctrine-migrations-generate` | renamed `create-migration` | reversible pair through `sqlx migrate add -r` |
| `setup-test-db`, `setup-load-test-db` | kept | the second acts only on the isolated environment |
| `load-fixtures` | dropped | the PHP fixture loaded nothing |
| `phpcsfixer` | renamed `format` (fix) and `format-check` (gate) | fix-style and check-style targets are separate |
| `psalm` | renamed `static-analysis` | |
| `psalm-security` | replaced by `static-analysis`, `check-security` and the CodeQL job | no taint tool runs locally |
| `psalm-security-sarif` | renamed `static-analysis-sarif` | |
| `phpmd` | renamed `complexity` | |
| `phpinsights` | replaced by `format-check`, `static-analysis`, `complexity`, `architecture` | no composite score exists for Rust |
| `deptrac` | renamed `architecture` | |
| `deptrac-debug` | merged into `architecture` | the rule `arch::uncovered` names every unassigned crate |
| `rector-apply` | renamed `static-analysis-fix` | |
| `rector-ci` | merged into `static-analysis` | a pending machine-applicable fix is a finding |
| `validate-configuration` | kept | now `cargo xtask config-guard` |
| `unit-tests`, `integration-tests`, `all-tests`, `test`, `bats` | kept | |
| `behat` | renamed `e2e-tests` | |
| `tests-with-coverage`, `coverage-html`, `coverage-xml` | kept | one output directory, `target/coverage/` |
| `infection` | renamed `mutation-tests` | plus `mutation-tests-diff` |

| `build-spectral-docker` | dropped | the stock Spectral image runs with `--user` |
| `validate-openapi-spec`, `openapi-diff`, `schemathesis-validate` | kept | oasdiff fails on breaking changes; Schemathesis tests the production image |
| `build-k6-docker` | dropped | the stock K6 image is used |
| `smoke-load-tests`, `average-load-tests`, `stress-load-tests`, `spike-load-tests`, `load-tests` | kept | isolated environment |
| `execute-load-tests-script` | kept | starts the isolated environment; rejects an empty `scenario` |
| `aws-load-tests`, `aws-load-tests-cleanup` | kept | options can be passed through Make, `repo_url` (`-u`) among them |
| `ci`, `all`, `ci-sequential` | kept | the seven stages in order |
| `ci-preflight`, `ci-static-analysis`, `ci-mutation` | kept | contents redefined; no mutating step |
| `ci-deptrac` | merged into `ci-static-analysis` | |
| `ci-tests-and-openapi` | split into `ci-tests` and `ci-contracts` | |

New targets without a PHP counterpart: `doctor`, `bootstrap`, `start-deps`, `ensure-deps`, `ensure-database`, `build-prod-image`, `format-repo`, `lint-code`, `lint-rustdoc`, `check-crate-isolation`, `validate-sqlx-metadata`, `doc-tests`, `unused-dependencies`, `unused-dependencies-fix`, `mutation-tests-diff`, `validate-contract-snapshots`, `graphql-diff`, `lint-load-tests`, `migrate-rollback`, `sqlx-prepare`, `check-security-offline`, `secrets-scan`, `image-scan`, `docs-check`, `validate-architecture-model`, the ten `lint-*` and `validate-invariants` targets, `install-hooks`, `pre-commit`, `pre-push`, `check-commit-message`, the five `bmalph-*` targets, `new-context`, `ci-list`, `ci-delivery` and `ci-cli`.

Removed since the first version because no requirement asks for them: `run` (it ran cargo on the host outside the execution switch; `cargo run -p service -- serve` works without a wrapper) and `migrate-status`.

## CI-only steps

These steps of the hosted pipeline have no place in `make ci`. Each has a reason.

| Step | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| G28, the pull-request title check | needs the pull request; `make check-commit-message` with `COMMIT_TITLE` set runs the same rule locally |
| Evaluation of the two approval labels | local runs read `CONFIG_CHANGE_APPROVED` and `BREAKING_CHANGE_APPROVED` from the environment and otherwise fail and print the label name; only CI can read the labels |
| CodeQL analysis and the SARIF upload | publications without a threshold of their own; no local runner exists |
| The Codecov upload and the artifact uploads | publication, not verification |
| The full sharded mutation run | `make mutation-tests` exists locally but is not part of `make ci`: it takes up to an hour, so CI runs it on `main` and on a schedule, and `make ci` runs `mutation-tests-diff` for the changed code |

## Gate targets: passing run and negative test

A gate target has its negative test in the Bats suite and no second passing run there. The passing run is the stage of `make ci` named below and the CI job of the gate, so the suite does not repeat it. Stage 7 holds the suite itself.

| Gate | Target | Passing run | Negative test (Bats file) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| G1 | `format-check` | stage 2 of `make ci` | `make_quality_gates.bats` (unformatted lines appended to `xtask/src/main.rs`) |
| G2 | `static-analysis` | stage 2 | `make_quality_gates.bats` (an `unwrap`; a `SystemTime::now()` call) |
| G3 | `complexity` | stage 2 | `make_quality_gates.bats` (a six-parameter function) |
| G4 | `architecture` | stage 2 | `make_quality_gates.bats` (the checker's fixture workspace) |

| G9 | `secrets-scan` | stage 1 | `make_security.bats` (a key pair generated at test time) |
| G10 | `image-scan` | stage 6 | `make_security.bats` (a vulnerable fixture image) |
| G11 | `doc-tests`, `tests-with-coverage` | stage 3 | `make_tests.bats` (a failing test appended to `xtask`) |
| G12 | `tests-with-coverage` | stage 3 | `make_tests.bats` (a failing integration test) |
| G13 | `e2e-tests` | stage 3 | `make_tests.bats` (a feature with an undefined step) |
| G14 | `tests-with-coverage` | stage 3 | `make_tests.bats` (an uncovered function) |
| G15 | `mutation-tests-diff` | stage 5 | `make_tests.bats` (an uncovered function: a `MISSED` line) |
| G16 | `bats` | stage 7 | `make_general.bats` (a failing suite fixture) |
| G17 | `validate-contract-snapshots` | stage 4 | `make_contracts.bats` (a changed snapshot per file) |
| G18 | `validate-openapi-spec` | stage 4 | `make_contracts.bats` (an operation description removed) |
| G19 | `openapi-diff` | stage 4 | `make_contracts.bats` (a required response property removed) |
| G20 | `graphql-diff` | stage 4 | `make_contracts.bats` (a field removed) |
| G21 | `schemathesis-validate` | stage 6 | `make_contracts.bats` (an undocumented path added) |
| G22 | `smoke-load-tests` | stage 6 | `make_load_tests.bats` (a budget that cannot be met) |
| G23 | `lint-repo` | stage 1 | `make_repository.bats` (one test per linter) |
| G24 | `lint-load-tests` | stage 1 | `make_load_tests.bats` (a script with `console.log` and `==`) |
| G25 | `validate-configuration` | stage 1 | `make_quality_gates.bats` (a comment appended to `clippy.toml`) |
| G26 | `docs-check` | stage 2 | `make_repository.bats` (an unknown target cited in `README.md`) |
| G27 | `validate-architecture-model` | stage 1 | `make_repository.bats` and `check_architecture_model.bats` |
| G28 | `check-commit-message` | CI only (pull-request job `title`) | `make_hooks_and_commits.bats` (each rejected example) |
| G29 | `check-crate-isolation` | stage 2 | `make_quality_gates.bats` (a function that breaks the build of one crate alone) |
| G30 | `validate-sqlx-metadata` | stage 3 | `make_tests.bats` (one file of `.sqlx/` removed) |
| G31 | `validate-invariants` | stage 1 | `make_repository.bats` and `check_invariants.bats` (one test per rule) |

## Targets without a Bats test

The suite tests the targets that are not gates and the surface behaviour; the passing run of a gate is not repeated (see above). These targets have no Bats test, each with its reason.

- `aws-load-tests` without local mode and `aws-load-tests-cleanup` against AWS: no credentials in CI. The LocalStack dry run is tested.
- `average-load-tests`, `stress-load-tests`, `spike-load-tests` and `load-tests`: minutes of load. The shared runner path is tested through `smoke-load-tests` and `execute-load-tests-script`.
- `mutation-tests`: up to an hour. It is the mutation command without the diff, and the same command line is tested through `mutation-tests-diff`.
- `coverage-xml` and `coverage-html`: a second and a third instrumented run of the suites. Their report commands are part of the tested `tests-with-coverage` sequence or differ from it in the output format only.
- `bootstrap`: run by the scheduled workflow.
- `update`: rewrites the lock file.
- `build`: minutes of image build. Its command line is tested with a Make dry run (`-n`).
- `format`, `format-repo`, `static-analysis-fix`, `unused-dependencies-fix` and `sqlx-prepare`: fix-style targets that rewrite tracked files.
- `ci` in full: tested with `CI_STAGES` and a Make dry run (`-n`).

The aliases and helper targets have no test of their own either; the target they point at, or the target that calls them, carries the test:

- Aliases: `up` (alias of `start`), `clean` (alias of `purge`), `test` (alias of `all-tests`), `all` and `ci-sequential` (aliases of `ci`).
- Helper targets: `ensure-deps` and `ensure-database` (prerequisites of the tested targets that need services), `setup-load-test-db` (called by the isolated-environment wrapper), `bmalph-claude` and `bmalph-codex` (call `bmalph-install` with a fixed platform), the stage targets `ci-preflight`, `ci-static-analysis`, `ci-tests`, `ci-contracts`, `ci-mutation`, `ci-delivery` and `ci-cli` (each recipe is generated from its `CI_*_TARGETS` variable, one line per gate, so a failing gate stops its stage; a Bats test checks that a dry run of `make ci` runs exactly the sequence that `make ci-list` prints), `static-analysis-sarif` (writes the lint findings in a publication format; the gate is `static-analysis`), `lint-code` and `lint-rustdoc` (the two halves of `static-analysis`), `all-tests`, `unit-tests` and `integration-tests` (compositions of the suites that the gates G11 to G13 run), `install` (downloads tools; run by `bootstrap`), `pre-push` (runs `unit-tests`) and `sh` (opens an interactive shell).

## Inputs that only a script reads

These inputs are not Make variables, so they are not in the environment reference. A script reads them from the environment.

| Input | Read by | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `COMMIT_TITLE` | `check-commit-message` | the pull-request title to check; read from the environment so that a title cannot inject shell text into a recipe |
| `COMMIT_MSG_FILE` | `check-commit-message` | the file of the commit message, set by the commit-msg hook |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | the development image build | optional build secret that raises the rate limit of tool downloads |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`, `AWS_REGION` | `aws-load-tests` | credentials of the cloud load run; the instance and bucket it creates cost money until `aws-load-tests-cleanup` removes them |
| `MAKE_COMMAND` | `doctor` | the GNU Make that runs the Makefile, set by the `doctor` and `bootstrap` recipes; without it the doctor checks the `make` on `PATH` (on macOS, with Homebrew, run `gmake` or put its `gnubin` directory first on `PATH`) |
| `MAKE` | the git hooks | the make the hooks run; without it they use `gmake` when it exists, else `make` |
| `ALLOW_PROTECTED_CONFIG_EDIT` | the assistant hook | set to `1` to allow an assistant edit of a protected configuration file |

## Service targets

A service defines its own targets in the file make/service.mk, which the `Makefile` loads with `-include`, and documents them in docs/make-targets-service.md. The template ships neither file, so a template sync cannot change them, and the drift check reads both references.
